## Git Contribution Guidelines

### Branching Models 

- Use main (or master) branch as the stable production code.

- Create feature branches from main using the format: <br>
    `feature/<brief-description>`
   

- For bug fixes, use: <br>
    `bugfix/<issue-description>`

- For experiments or spikes, use: <br>
    `experiment/<topic>`

### Commit Guidelines
Write clear, concise commit messages in present tense (50 characters or less for summary).

Structure commits as atomic and focused changes.

Use the format:

```
<type>: <summary>

<optional detailed explanation>
```

Where `<type>` can be:

- feat (new feature)

- fix (bug fix)

- docs (documentation)

- style (formatting, no code change)

- refactor (code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)

- test (adding or fixing tests)
